Hello,

This has been a dream of mine to create a SDR Scanner with little to no hassle to get installed and running, due to the simple fact the other scripts well one i could never get working. so i already have intergrated voice decoder in this.
Here is the kicker this project is incomplete i just don't have the time to continue to work on the script just when i think i got bam fatal error one error leads to about 50. this project has a kick ass interface 
i set the interface up like a panasonic toughbook with digital displays working buttons with leds.
to be honest i need someone who is more capable than i am at coding im lucky i got this far as to im a automation & robotics engineering tech during the day. i can write plc progs allday but hey im never afraid to ask for help.
So if the Community wants to try an get this thing working that would be awesome i would just like to see it run once. thanks git hub
